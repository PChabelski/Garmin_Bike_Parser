Script that reads biking tcx files from Garmin website and outputs a csv file with the data. containing all location/heartrate/speed data.
The .tcx files are downloaded from the Garmin website and stored in the 'tcx_raw_files' folder.
The output of the process is a csv file in the 'output' folder that contains all of the information stitched together.

I personally use this to feed a Tableau dashboard that shows my biking activities.

Inspiration for this script was taken from a Youtube video: https://youtu.be/OxSX9wv9xvY.
